Ultrasonic Distance Sensor:

Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - HC-SR04

[Distance Range]
* ranging accuracy can reach and control circuit
2 cm to 400 cm

0.7874 in to 157.48in ~ 13 ft 

VCC (POwer)
Trig (trigger)
Echo (Receive)
GND (ground)

Working Voltage	: 5 V
Working Current	: 15 mA

Measuring Angle 	: 15 degree

Trigger Input signal	:10uSTTL pulse (Transistor-transistor logic)
Echo output Signal	: Input TTL lever signal and the range in proportion
Dimension: 45*20*15 mm

Timing Diagram:

Need to supply a short 10uS pulse to the trigger input to start the ranging , and the module will send out an 8 cycle burst of ultrsound at 40kHz

you can calculate the ranfe through the time interval between sending trigger signal and receiving echo signal
